    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this note the finite difference method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) will be presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking, a finite difference method consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discretize the domain on which the equation is defined.\n",
    "2. On each grid point, replace the derivatives with an approximation, using the values in neighbouring grid points.\n",
    "3. Replace the exact solutions by their approximations.\n",
    "4. Solve the resulting system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first see how to find approximations to the derivative of a function, and then how these can be used to solve boundary value problems like\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u'' + p(x)u' + q(x)u = r(x), \\, a \\leq x \\leq b, \\, u(a) = u_a, \\,  u(b) = u_b,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and time dependent partial differential equations like the heat equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_t = u_{xx}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique described here is, however, applicable to several other PDEs, and it is therefore important to try to understand the underlying idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main tool for finite difference methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sufficiently smooth function f. How can we find an approximation to f'(x) or f''(x) in some given point x, just by using evaluation of the function itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of f is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(x) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sufficiently small value of h, the right hand side can be used an approximation to f'(x). A small collection of the most used approximations to f'(x) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f'(x) \\approx \\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}, & \\text{Forward difference}, \\\\ \\frac{f(x) - f(x-h)}{h}, & \\text{Backward difference}, \\\\ \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}, & \\text{Central difference}. \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is taken directly from the definition, and so is the second, and the third is just the mean of the first two. A common approximation to the second derivative is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f''(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the method on the function f(x) = sin(x) at the point x = π/4. Compare with the exact derivative. Try different step sizes, e.g. h = 0.1, h = 0.01, h = 0.001. Notice how the error in each case changes with h."
