BLACK-SCHOLES CRANK-NICOLSON FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD REPORT
=================================================================

METHOD DESCRIPTION:
- Uses Crank-Nicolson finite difference scheme
- Time-centered average of explicit and implicit schemes
- Unconditionally stable (no restrictions on time step)
- Second-order accurate in both time and space
- Most commonly used method in practice

INPUT PARAMETERS:
- Current stock price (S0): $100.00
- Strike price (K): $100.00
- Time to maturity (T): 0.25 years
- Risk-free rate (r): 5.0%
- Volatility (σ): 20.0%

NUMERICAL PARAMETERS:
- Maximum stock price: $200.00
- Number of stock price steps: 100
- Number of time steps: 1000
- Stock price step size (ΔS): $2.00
- Time step size (Δt): 0.000250 years

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS:
- Matrix system: Two tridiagonal matrices (A and B)
- Left-hand side: (I - Δt/2·L)·V^{j+1}
- Right-hand side: (I + Δt/2·L)·V^j
- Boundary conditions:
  * At S=0: V(0,t) = 0 (call worthless)
  * At S=S_max: Linear extrapolation
- Time integration: Backward from expiry to present
- Spatial operator L includes diffusion, convection, and reaction terms

RESULTS:
- Black-Scholes call option value: $4.5949
- Computation time: 0.073153 seconds

METHOD CHARACTERISTICS:
ADVANTAGES:
- Second-order accuracy in both time and space
- Unconditionally stable for any time step size
- Optimal balance between accuracy and stability
- Industry standard for parabolic PDEs
- No oscillations or artificial damping

DISADVANTAGES:
- Requires solving linear system at each time step
- More complex implementation than explicit method
- Requires two matrix operations per time step
- Higher memory requirements for matrix storage

CONVERGENCE NOTES:
- Error decreases as O(Δt²) + O(ΔS²)
- Optimal convergence rate among finite difference methods
- Time step can be chosen based on accuracy needs only
- Spatial grid refinement improves accuracy quadratically
- Most accurate method for given grid resolution

COMPARISON WITH OTHER METHODS:
- More accurate than explicit or implicit methods
- Computational cost between explicit and implicit
- Best choice for production applications
- Standard in financial software packages
