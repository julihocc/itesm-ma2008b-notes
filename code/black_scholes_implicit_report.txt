BLACK-SCHOLES IMPLICIT FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD REPORT
============================================================

METHOD DESCRIPTION:
- Uses implicit finite difference scheme
- Solves tridiagonal system at each time step
- Unconditionally stable (no restrictions on time step)
- First-order accurate in time

INPUT PARAMETERS:
- Current stock price (S0): $100.00
- Strike price (K): $100.00
- Time to maturity (T): 0.25 years
- Risk-free rate (r): 5.0%
- Volatility (σ): 20.0%

NUMERICAL PARAMETERS:
- Maximum stock price: $200.00
- Number of stock price steps: 100
- Number of time steps: 1000
- Stock price step size (ΔS): $2.00
- Time step size (Δt): 0.000250 years

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS:
- Matrix system: Tridiagonal (efficient Thomas algorithm)
- Boundary conditions:
  * At S=0: V(0,t) = 0 (call worthless)
  * At S=S_max: Linear extrapolation
- Time integration: Backward from expiry to present

RESULTS:
- Black-Scholes call option value: $4.5944
- Computation time: 0.075390 seconds

METHOD CHARACTERISTICS:
ADVANTAGES:
- Unconditionally stable for any time step size
- Can use larger time steps than explicit method
- No stability restrictions on parameters
- Efficient tridiagonal solver available

DISADVANTAGES:
- Requires solving linear system at each time step
- Only first-order accurate in time
- More complex implementation than explicit method
- Additional computational overhead per time step

CONVERGENCE NOTES:
- Error decreases as O(Δt) + O(ΔS²)
- Time step can be chosen based on accuracy needs
- Spatial grid refinement improves accuracy
- Stable for all practical parameter values
