# Numerical Integration

## The **trapezoidal rule**,

$$
\int_{x_0}^{x_n} y(x)\, dx \approx \frac{1}{2}h(y_0 + 2y_1 + \cdots + 2y_{n-1} + y_n)
$$

is an elementary, but typical, **composite numerical integration formula**, known as the **composite trapezoidal rule**. This rule approximates the area under the curve $y(x)$ over the interval $[x_0, x_n]$ by dividing the interval into $n$ equal subintervals of width $h = \frac{x_n - x_0}{n}$, and using **straight line segments** to connect successive points $(x_i, y_i)$. These segments form trapezoids, whose areas are straightforward to compute.

The formula effectively replaces the integrand $y(x)$ with a piecewise linear function, interpolating $y(x)$ at the mesh points $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n$. The sum of the areas of these trapezoids gives the approximation to the integral.

This approach is simple yet remarkably effective for sufficiently smooth functions. However, like any numerical method, it introduces an error, known as the **truncation error**, which quantifies the deviation from the exact integral. For the trapezoidal rule, the error is approximately

$$
- \frac{(x_n - x_0)\, h^2}{12} \, y^{(2)}(\xi)
$$

for some $\xi \in [x_0, x_n]$, where $y^{(2)}(\xi)$ denotes the second derivative of $y(x)$ at some point $\xi$ in the integration interval. This expression shows that the error decreases quadratically with the step size $h$, assuming $y^{(2)}(x)$ remains bounded. Consequently, halving the step size reduces the error by roughly a factor of four, reflecting the **second-order accuracy** of the method.

Thus, the trapezoidal rule provides a good balance between simplicity and accuracy, particularly for functions that are at least twice continuously differentiable on the interval of integration.

## Solved Problem 14.5

> Apply the trapezoidal rule to approximate the integral of $\sqrt{x}$ over the interval $[1.00, 1.30]$ using six equally spaced subintervals. Then compare the result with the exact value of the integral.

Dividing the interval $[1.00, 1.30]$ into $n = 6$ subintervals gives a step size of $h = 0.05$. The corresponding partition points are:

$$
x_i = 1.00,\ 1.05,\ 1.10,\ 1.15,\ 1.20,\ 1.25,\ 1.30
$$

Evaluating the function $y(x) = \sqrt{x}$ at these points yields:

$$
y_i = 1.00000,\ 1.02470,\ 1.04881,\ 1.07238,\ 1.09545,\ 1.11803,\ 1.14017
$$

Applying the trapezoidal rule:

$$
\int_{1.00}^{1.30} \sqrt{x}\, dx \approx \frac{0.05}{2} \left[y_0 + 2(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 + y_5) + y_6\right]
$$

$$
= \frac{0.05}{2} \left[1.00000 + 2(1.02470 + 1.04881 + 1.07238 + 1.09545 + 1.11803) + 1.14017\right]
$$

$$
= \frac{0.05}{2} \left[1.00000 + 2(5.35937) + 1.14017\right] = \frac{0.05}{2} \cdot 12.85891 = 0.32147
$$

The exact value of the integral is:

$$
\int_{1.00}^{1.30} \sqrt{x}\, dx = \frac{2}{3} \left(1.3^{3/2} - 1\right) \approx 0.32149
$$

Thus, the trapezoidal approximation is accurate to five decimal places, with an absolute error of approximately $0.00002$.
