# Numerical Integration

## The **trapezoidal rule**,

$$
\int_{x_0}^{x_n} y(x)\, dx \approx \frac{1}{2}h(y_0 + 2y_1 + \cdots + 2y_{n-1} + y_n)
$$

is an elementary, but typical, **composite numerical integration formula**, known as the **composite trapezoidal rule**. This rule approximates the area under the curve $y(x)$ over the interval $[x_0, x_n]$ by dividing the interval into $n$ equal subintervals of width $h = \frac{x_n - x_0}{n}$, and using **straight line segments** to connect successive points $(x_i, y_i)$. These segments form trapezoids, whose areas are straightforward to compute.

The formula effectively replaces the integrand $y(x)$ with a piecewise linear function, interpolating $y(x)$ at the mesh points $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n$. The sum of the areas of these trapezoids gives the approximation to the integral.

This approach is simple yet remarkably effective for sufficiently smooth functions. However, like any numerical method, it introduces an error, known as the **truncation error**, which quantifies the deviation from the exact integral. For the trapezoidal rule, the error is approximately

$$
- \frac{(x_n - x_0)\, h^2}{12} \, y^{(2)}(\xi)
$$

for some $\xi \in [x_0, x_n]$, where $y^{(2)}(\xi)$ denotes the second derivative of $y(x)$ at some point $\xi$ in the integration interval. This expression shows that the error decreases quadratically with the step size $h$, assuming $y^{(2)}(x)$ remains bounded. Consequently, halving the step size reduces the error by roughly a factor of four, reflecting the **second-order accuracy** of the method.

Thus, the trapezoidal rule provides a good balance between simplicity and accuracy, particularly for functions that are at least twice continuously differentiable on the interval of integration.
