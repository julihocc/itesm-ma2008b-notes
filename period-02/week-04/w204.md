# Numerical Methods For Ordinary Differential Equations

Here we give methods to solve the following initial-value problem of an ordinary differential equation:

$$
\tag{1}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= f(x,t) \\
x(t_0) &= x_0
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$

The methods will use a computational grid:

$$
\tag{2}
t_n = t_0 + nh
$$
where $h$ is the grid size.
