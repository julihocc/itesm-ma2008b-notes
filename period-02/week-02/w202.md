# Roots of Equations

The problem treated in this chapter is the ancient problem of finding roots of equations or of systems of equations. The long list of available methods shows the long history of this problem and its continuing importance. 

Which method to use depends upon whether one needs all the roots of a particular equation or only a few, whether the roots are real or complex, simple or multiple, whether one has a ready first approximation or not, and so on.
