# Roots of Equations

The problem treated in this chapter is the ancient problem of finding roots of equations or of systems of equations. The long list of available methods shows the long history of this problem and its continuing importance.

Which method to use depends upon whether one needs all the roots of a particular equation or only a few, whether the roots are real or complex, simple or multiple, whether one has a ready first approximation or not, and so on.


### The iterative method

The **iterative method** solves $ x = F(x) $ by the recursion

$$
x_n = F(x_{n-1})
$$

and converges to a root if $ |F'(x)| \leq L < 1 $. The error $ e_n = r - x_n $, where $ r $ is the exact root, has the property

$$
e_n \simeq F'(r) e_{n-1}
$$

so that each iteration reduces the error by a factor near $ F'(r) $. If $ F'(r) $ is near 1 this is slow convergence.

The $ \Delta^2 $ **process can accelerate convergence** under some circumstances. It consists of the approximation

$$
r \simeq x_{n+2} - \frac{(\Delta x_{n+1})^2}{\Delta^2 x_n}
$$

which may be derived from the error property given above.
