# Roots of Equations

The problem treated in this chapter is the ancient problem of finding roots of equations or of systems of equations. The long list of available methods shows the long history of this problem and its continuing importance.

Which method to use depends upon whether one needs all the roots of a particular equation or only a few, whether the roots are real or complex, simple or multiple, whether one has a ready first approximation or not, and so on.

## The iterative method

The **iterative method** solves $ x = F(x) $ by the recursion

$$
x_n = F(x_{n-1})
$$

and converges to a root if $ |F'(x)| \leq L < 1 $. The error $ e_n = r - x_n $, where $ r $ is the exact root, has the property

$$
e_n \simeq F'(r) e_{n-1}
$$

so that each iteration reduces the error by a factor near $ F'(r) $. If $ F'(r) $ is near 1 this is slow convergence.

The $ \Delta^2 $ **process can accelerate convergence** under some circumstances. It consists of the approximation

$$
r \simeq x_{n+2} - \frac{(\Delta x_{n+1})^2}{\Delta^2 x_n}
$$

which may be derived from the error property given above.

### Solved Problems

#### Problem 25.1

 > Prove that if $ r $ is a root of $ f(x) = 0 $ and if this equation is rewritten in the form $ x = F(x) $ in such a way that $ |F'(x)| \leq L < 1 $ in an interval $ I $ centered at $ x = r $, then the sequence $ x_n = F(x_{n-1}) $ with $ x_0 $ arbitrary but in the interval $ I $ has $ \lim x_n = r $.

First we find

$$
|F(x) - F(y)| = |F'(\xi)(x - y)| \leq L |x - y|
$$

provided both $ x $ and $ y $ are close to $ r $. Actually it is this Lipschitz condition rather than the more restrictive condition on $ F'(x) $ which we need. Now

$$
|x_n - r| = |F(x_{n-1}) - F(r)| \leq L |x_{n-1} - r|
$$

so that, since $ L < 1 $, each approximation is at least as good as its predecessor. This guarantees that all our approximations are in the interval $ I $, so that nothing interrupts the algorithm. Applying the last inequality $ n $ times, we have

$$
|x_n - r| \leq L^n |x_0 - r|
$$

and since $ L < 1 $, $ \lim x_n = r $.

The convergence is illustrated in Fig. 25-1. Note that choosing $ F(x_{n-1}) $ as the next $ x_n $ amounts to following one of the horizontal line

#### Problem 25.2

> In the year 1225 Leonardo of Pisa studied the equation
> $$
> f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 10x - 20 = 0
> $$
>and produced $ x = 1.368808107 $. Nobody knows by what method Leonardo found this value but it is a remarkable result for his time. Apply the method of Problem 25.1 to obtain this result.

The equation can be put into the form $ x = F(x) $ in many ways. We take $ x = F(x) = \frac{20}{x^2 + 2x + 10} $, which suggests the iteration

$$
x_n = \frac{20}{x_{n-1}^2 + 2x_{n-1} + 10}
$$

With $ x_0 = 1 $ we find $ x_1 = \frac{20}{13} \approx 1.538461538 $. Continuing the iteration produces the sequence of Table 25.1. Sure enough, on the twenty-fourth round Leonardoâ€™s value appears.
